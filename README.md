A simple web application to measure your reaction time.

## How It Works

The test measures the time it takes for you to react to a visual stimulus.

1.  The screen will display a message "Click to start".
2.  After you click, the screen will turn red and show "Wait for green...".
3.  When the screen turns green, click as fast as you can!
4.  Your reaction time will be displayed in milliseconds.
